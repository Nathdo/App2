# Save & Go â€“ Smart Financial Assistant for Students ğŸ’°

Save & Go is a smart financial planning system built to help students in Israel better manage their income, expenses, and savings goals.

## Project Overview

Only **32%** of students save money, and **22%** take loansâ€”often over â‚ª20,000.  
**Save & Go** solves this with a personalized assistant that helps students:

- Track their income and expenses.
- Define savings goals.
- Receive optimized monthly saving suggestions.
- Get recommendations when goals are unreachable.

Our mission: **Make financial wellness accessible to every student.**

3. The system calculates the **optimal monthly saving plan**.
4. It proposes solutions if goals are currently unreachable.
